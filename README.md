# project-2-magic-8-ball-eli-s-shipping-Diegob421
This was the second python project that I worked on. In this project I worked on a magic 8-ball and you would just ask it a question and it would tell you an answer. 
The other thing that I worked on in this project something that would calculate the shipping cost of 3 different shipping methods and calculate which was the cheapest
and best option to go with.
